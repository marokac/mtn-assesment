# mtn-assesment

## Get started

### Clone the repo

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/marokac/mtn-assesment.git
cd mtn-assesmentr
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
ng serve
```

The `ng serve` command builds (compiles TypeScript and copies assets) the application into `dist/`, watches for changes to the source files, and runs  `webpark server` on port `4200`.

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.
